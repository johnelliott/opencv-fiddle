# js-opencv-fiddle

A collection of files to explore using opencv in node. Currently developing a streaming pedestrain detector `ped-duplex-stream.js`.

The server simply takes requests to load files with CURL. The front-end allows something similar with drag and drop.

The npm scripts in `package.json` give a hint about what `.avi` files and locations I'm working with.
